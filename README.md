# universe-starter-agent

This is a fork from universe starter agent. I add :
 * Several possibles models (VIN 1D and 2D, CNN, LSTM) 
 * The implementation of A3C+ algorithm from [Pkumusic](https://github.com/pkumusic/E-DRL)
 * A lot of arguments to easily change the model parameters.
 * The possibility to use a decreasing learning rate, with a log scale

I also remove the universe part, because I'm not working with it and it's difficult to install it 
on my cluster.


# Dependencies

* Python 3.5 or 3.6
* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) 1.0
* [tmux](https://tmux.github.io/) (the start script opens up a tmux session with multiple windows)
* [htop](https://hisham.hm/htop/) (shown in one of the tmux windows)
* [gym](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gym)
* gym[atari]
* [opencv-python](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/opencv-python)
* [numpy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/numpy)
* [scipy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/scipy)

## Atari Pong

`python train.py --num-workers 2 --env-id PongDeterministic-v3 --log-dir /tmp/pong`

The command above will train an agent on Atari Pong using ALE simulator.
It will see two workers that will be learning in parallel (`--num-workers` flag) and will output intermediate results into given directory.

The code will launch the following processes:
* worker-0 - a process that runs policy gradient
* worker-1 - a process identical to process-1, that uses different random noise from the environment
* ps - the parameter server, which synchronizes the parameters among the different workers
* tb - a tensorboard process for convenient display of the statistics of learning

Once you start the training process, it will create a tmux session with a window for each of these processes. You can connect to them by typing `tmux a` in the console.
Once in the tmux session, you can see all your windows with `ctrl-b w`.
To switch to window number 0, type: `ctrl-b 0`. Look up tmux documentation for more commands.

To access TensorBoard to see various monitoring metrics of the agent, open [http://localhost:12345/](http://localhost:12345/) in a browser.

Using 16 workers, the agent should be able to solve `PongDeterministic-v3` (not VNC) within 30 minutes (often less) on an `m4.10xlarge` instance.
Using 32 workers, the agent is able to solve the same environment in 10 minutes on an `m4.16xlarge` instance.
If you run this experiment on a high-end MacBook Pro, the above job will take just under 2 hours to solve Pong.

Add '--visualise' toggle if you want to visualise the worker using env.render() as follows:

`python train.py --num-workers 2 --env-id PongDeterministic-v3 --log-dir /tmp/pong --visualise`

For best performance, it is recommended for the number of workers to not exceed available number of CPU cores.

You can stop the experiment with `tmux kill-session` command.
